    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we create a more sophisticated bot, which defines the exploration metric as \"the fraction of words we expect to exclude if we guess this word\". This has several advantages compared with v1.0.0:\n",
    "- At every turn it considers how much _additional_ information will be introduced on top of what is already known, and therefore does not give any score to \"rediscovering\" known information.\n",
    "- This metric partially accounts for letter position, since it knows which words will be eliminated by learning where a letter is present.\n",
    "However, there are three disadvantages:\n",
    "- The expectation value is expensive to compute in the early game, and must therefore be estimated numerically using $N_A$ samples. This still takes longer than v1.0.0, although makes the computation tractable, and it means that the score is not calculated exactly (we can use MC variance to estimate the scale of this problem).\n",
    "- We still have no concept of \"planning ahead\", since at every turn the bot guesses whatever word has the highest assigned score. In reality it may be better to form long-term strategies and ultimately optimise the distribution of \"expected number of turns until victory\" according to your goals (prioritising speed vs winning before turn 7). In principle this distribution can be exactly numerically evaluated but is far too computationally expensive.\n",
    "- When there are only two-three possible answers left, we may find that several already dis-allowed words have a similar exclusion rate to the words left in the game. In this case it would make sense to prioritise guesses which may be correct.\n",
    "We therefore introduce an exploitation score which represents \"the probability that this answer is correct\", and a hyperparameter $\\lambda$ which controls the balance between exploration and exploitation. \n",
    "\n",
    "We discover the following things:\n",
    "- The updated exploration metric removes the tail of games which are lost, since we have eliminated information rediscovery. This tail only re-emerges when we choose very suboptimal values for $N_A$ and $\\lambda$.\n",
    "- Generally, $\\lambda \\sim 0.1-0.5$ works well. At low $\\lambda$ values, we do not start guessing possible answers early enough. At high $\\lambda$ values, we start guessing possible answers when it would be better to choose a dis-allowed word which provides more information. This is intuitive, because\n",
    "    - When there is one word left, exploration score is $0$ for all words, so any positive $\\lambda$ will result in the correct word being chosen. We therefore do not need to hard-code the policy of choosing an answer when it is the only possibility remaining.\n",
    "    - When there are two words left, each one will have an exploration score of $0.5$. Other words will have an exploration score of $0.5$ or $0$. However, the allowed words will also have an exploitation score of $0.5$ compared with $0$ for the dis-allowed guesses. We therefore pick randomly from the two allowed answers for any positive $\\lambda$ (or alphabetically, which gives identical average results for a uniformly distributed population).\n",
    "    - When there are three or more words left, there is a balance between exploration and exploitation. The degree to which allowed words are favoured depends on the value of $\\lambda$. When $\\lambda=0.5$, we naturally balance the probability of being corect with the probability of excluding other words, and select the best word accordingly.\n",
    "- We find that even small $N_A \\in \\left[5, 10\\right]$ work suprisingly well, presumably because there are a number of high quality words at any step and it is likely that one of them is found at the top of the score distribution. Conversely, all of the low-quality words can be eliminated when only considering a small number of answers. For these reasons, $N_A=20$ already appears close to optimal, with higher values not providing an obvious improvement\n",
    "- We find that high $\\lambda$ is more useful when $N_A$ is very small ($\\sim 5$), since guessing an allowed word in later turns is better than guessing based on an inaccurate score estimate. We expect that$\\lambda$ will be increasingly useful if we consider possible answers which are weighted according to how common they are. Then we will favour common words over rare ones. We will then 1. prefer to guess common words rather than rare ones due to their exploitation score, and 2. prefer to exclude common words since this maximises the exploration score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To balance execution time, probability of winning in fewer than $6$ moves, and the expected number of turns taken to win, we define $N_A=20$ and $\\lambda=0.1$ with \"AROSE\" as an intial guess to be approximately optimal bot settings**\n",

    "## Method details\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the following three ensembles. Ensemble $\\mathbb{W}_\\mathrm{all-words}$ is the set of all 5-letter words. Ensemble $\\mathbb{W}_\\mathrm{allowed}$ is the set of all 5-letter words which have not yet been excluded. Initially this is equal to $\\mathbb{W}_\\mathrm{allowed}$, but is updated every turn to eliminate any words which are excluded by the total information gathered thus far. Ensemble $\\mathbb{W}_\\mathrm{guess}$ is the set of all possible guesses. Initially this is equal to $\\mathbb{W}_\\mathrm{allowed}$, but each word is removed from $\\mathbb{W}_\\mathrm{guess}$ once it is guessed. *N.B. This was required for bot v1.0.0 to prevent repeatedly choosing the same word, but is not necessary for v1.1.0 because all previously guessed words would naturally be assigned a score of $0$ without any intervention.*\n",
    "\n",
    "For a possible guess $u \\in \\mathbb{W}_\\mathrm{guess}$, we define the score\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "s\\left(u\\right) = \\lambda \\cdot s_\\mathrm{exploit}\\left(u\\right) ~+~ \\left(1-\\lambda\\right) \\cdot s_\\mathrm{explore}\\left(u\\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "as a weighted sum of exploitation and exploration terms where \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "s_\\mathrm{exploit}\\left(u\\right) ~= \\begin{cases} 0 &\\text{if $u$ ruled out} \\\\ \\frac{1}{N_\\mathrm{allowed}} &\\text{otherwise}\\\\ \\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "is the estimated probability of a word having being selected as the answer based on what we know, which is a constant because our environment selects the answer from a uniform distribution, and $N_\\mathrm{allowed}$ is the number of possible answers remaining, and\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "s_\\mathrm{explore}\\left(u\\right) ~= \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathrm{v,w}\\in\\mathbb{W}_\\mathrm{allowed}} \\left[ p\\left(\\mathrm{exclude}~v~|~ \\mathrm{true}~w,~\\mathrm{guess}~u\\right) \\right] \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $p\\left(\\mathrm{exclude}~v~|~ \\mathrm{true}~w,~\\mathrm{guess}~u\\right)$ is the probability that word $v$ is excluded given that word $w$ was true and we guessed $u$. This term tells us what fraction of all remaining allowed words we expect to eliminate if we guess $u$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are $N_\\mathrm{allowed}$ words remaining, computing this expectation value exactly is $O\\left(N_\\mathrm{allowed}^2\\right)$ complexity. Since we must evaluate this expectation for all $N_\\mathrm{guess} \\sim 3000$ possible guesses, the total complexity is $O\\left(N_\\mathrm{guess}N_\\mathrm{allowed}^2\\right)$. At the start of the game when $N_\\mathrm{allowed} \\sim 3000$, this is prohibitively expensive. Even later in the game when $100 < N_\\mathrm{allowed} < 500$ it maybe still be very slow. Instead we estimate this expectation using a random subset of $N_A$ words from $\\mathbb{W}_\\mathrm{allowed}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are therefore $2$ hyperparameters associated with our model: the factor $\\lambda$ which balances exploitation versus exploration, and $N_A$ which controls the accuracy of the MC estimate for $s_\\mathrm{explore}\\left(u\\right)$. At every turn, the policy is to choose the word which maximises the score. If only one word remains in $\\mathbb{W}_\\mathrm{allowed}$, the answer is known and this is chosen instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we still do not have any concept of \"planning ahead\", and instead try to choose the optimal move at every turn, where optimality is defined by the score function. Since computing the score at the first step takes a long time, we will continue using 'AROSE' as the guess at the first turn. This is because the guess at the first turn is the same for all games, and when using $N_A=500$ we find that it lies close to the top of the score ranking so is considered to be a good choice by the algorithm.\n",
