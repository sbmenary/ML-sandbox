    "##  Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In WordleBot v1, we picked words based on heuristic notions of exploration and exploitation. Whilst empirically this seemed to work well, it had an insurmountable drawback: it cannot \"plan ahead\". This means that it cannot make the argument \"If I guess word A now and then either B or C afterwards (based on the information learned), I will on-average reach the true answer quicker than if I guess word D now, even though I estimate that D has a higher immediate return than A\". For example, human players sometimes find that guessing \"ADIEU\" as their first word provides a lot of information about which vowels are present, but restricts the performance of their _second_ guess because they are forced to re-use vowels for which they already have enough information. This seems to be a small drawback in practice, but would be conceptually nice to overcome. I am also interested in how much performance, if any, could be gained by applying forward-planning reasoning in an optimal way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we attempt to create a wordlebot which can \"plan ahead\". To do this, we forget about the exploration/exploitation heuristics and instead **pick whatever word provides the lowest expected number of turns to win** at every step. This is the same as implementing a greedy policy with a known optimal value function. As defined by this measure of success, we necessarily strike the optimal exploration/exploitation tradeoff without the need for an approximate parameterisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question becomes: how well can we estimate this quantity?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider that we have a set of possible words $\\mathbb{W}_\\text{all-words}$. At any time-step in the game, the current state $s \\in \\mathbb{S}$ is defined as the set of answers $\\mathbb{A} \\subset \\mathbb{W}_\\text{all-words}$ which have not yet been excluded. The state is _independent_ of how we arrived there - once we know what answers are still possible, we do not need to know anything about what was guessed on previous time-steps, or what constraints have been amassed thus far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once in state $s$, we can guess any word $g \\in \\mathbb{G}$. This will transform us into a new state $s'$. This transition is stochastic, since it is selected deterministically according to the (hidden) true answer $a_\\text{true}$. Since we know that $a_\\text{true}$ must be uniformly distributed across $\\mathbb{A}$, we can infer the probability distribution $p\\left(s'|s,g\\right)$ for transitioning into each possible state $s'$. Note that $s'=s$ in cases when our guess $g$ does not change the set of possible answers, e.g. when repeating a guess from a previous turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our objective is to minimise the expected number of turns taken to play the game, we assign a reward of $r=-1$ for every turn taken. Say that the game is on time-step $t$. The return amassed between now and the end of the game on time-step $T$ is $G_t = r_{t+1} + r_{t+2} + \\dots + r_{T+1}$. Note that we label the reward on the time-step _after_ the guess, so that guess $g_t$ on time-step $t$ is rewarded by an amount $r_{t+1}$. We add one special state to the state space $\\mathbb{S}$: the _terminal state_, which we transition to on time-step $T$ when we guess the correct answer. This transition still comes with a reward of $r_{T+1}=-1$, but it ends the game, so no further turns need to be taken (and so no more negative rewards accrued).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the observed return $G_t$ is undiscounted because our games will eventually end, and so we do not suffer from an infinite horizon problem. Furthermore, we do not wish to weight the rewards of earlier turns differently to those of later turns if we can avoid it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our game is defined by\n",
    "- the current state $s \\in \\mathbb{S}$\n",
    "- possible actions $g \\in \\mathbb{G}$ which induce stochastic transitions into new states according to probabilities $p\\left(s'|s,g\\right)$ (i.e. independently to the history of the game)\n",
    "- a reward associated with the transition\n",
    "\n",
    "then it is Markov Decision Process (MDP). We could try to solve this numerically using dynamic programming (e.g. through value iteration), or through RL methods such as $Q$-learning by performing repeated trials. We may try these later, but for now we will attempt to solve the game (almost) exactly. \n",
    "\n",
    "We assign the following objective: at every turn, we wish to guess whatever word will _minimise the expectation value of the number of turns required to win_. E.g. at time-step $t$, we find ourselves in state $t$ and wish to guess word g_t^* such that\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    Q\\left(s_t,g_t\\right) &= \\mathbb{E}_{a_\\text{true}} \\left[ G_t \\right] \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\mathbb{E}_{a_\\text{true}} \\left[ p\\left(s_{t+1}|s_t,g_t\\right) \\times \\text{argmax}_{g_{t+1}} Q\\left(s_{t+1},g_{t+1}\\right) \\right] \\\\\n",
    "    g_t^* &= \\text{argmax}_{g_t} Q\\left(s_t,g_t\\right)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "By writing the value function as $V\\left(s\\right) = \\text{max}_{g_t} Q\\left(s_t,g_t\\right)$, this gives us the recursive equation\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    Q\\left(s_t,g_t\\right) &= \\mathbb{E}_{a_\\text{true}} \\left[ p\\left(s_{t+1}|s_t,g_t\\right) \\times V\\left(s_{t+1}\\right) \\right] \\\\\n",
    "    V\\left(s_{t+1}\\right) &= \\text{max}_{g_{t+1}} ~\\mathbb{E}_{a_\\text{true}} \\left[ p\\left(s_{t+2}|s_{t+1},g_{t+1}\\right) \\times V\\left(s_{t+2}\\right) \\right] \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "If playing well, this equation does not recurse forever, since every chain must end with $V(s_\\text{terminal})=0$. However, when playing badly it may get stuck in loops since it must consider the possibility $s_{t+1}=s_t\\forall t$. We know this to have a return of $-\\infty$, however this cannot be specified without introducing new information into the state definition (such as what words have previously been guessed) which either (i) breaks the Markov property or (ii) explodes the size of the state space. Instead, we can exploit an interesting property, stated in two equivalent ways:\n",
    "- if a guess causes the transition $s_{t+1} = s_t$ for some $a_\\text{true}$, it must do this for all possible $a_\\text{true}$ (i.e. a guess only provides _no_ information if it does so for _all_ states, otherwise the lack of information would _itself_ be information, which is a paradox).\n",
    "- if a guess causes $s_{t+1} \\neq s_t$ for any $a_\\text{true}$, then it must do so for all others\n",
    "\n",
    "Since guesses which do not change state _must_ have an expected return _worse or the same as_ any other guess, we can ignore them from the _argmax_ computation. Using the properties above, if we pick a _single possible answer_, ask whether each possible guess $g$ returns the same state, and discard the guess from consideration if so. By doing this, we must reject _all_ and _only_ guesses which provide no information, saving us from infinite loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "We note that states with only one possible answer must satisfy $V\\left(s\\right)=-1 ~\\forall~ |s|=1$, and those with two possible answers must satisfy $V\\left(s\\right)=-1.5 ~\\forall~ |s|=2$. To simplify the state space, we will treat all one-answer states as terminal with an expected value of $-1$ (compared with $0$ for the terminal state representing a game win). We will not do this for two-answer states, but cross-check that they are evaluated with the correct expected value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our strategy is therefore as follows: at every turn, choose the guess which maximises $Q$. Each time we encounter a new state, we compute $V$ recursively and save it so that it can be retrieved next time we need it. In the recursive sum, we retrieve the $V$ for any already-evaluated states we encounter. Once $V$ is known for all states, the value of $Q$ can either be computed on-the fly (high computational cost, low memory) or backed up for quick access later on (low computational cost, high memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this approach, we learn the relevant parts of the value function on-the-fly by playing games. This means that we only need to evaluate states which might actually be visited during a game, and not all possible combinations of words. Each game we play, we may re-use any value functions evluated using past games. Once at least one game has been played for every $a_\\text{true} \\in \\mathbb{W}_\\text{all-words}$, we must have computed $V$ for all possible states, and no more evaluations need to be performed (only picking the best $Q$ at every turn).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the problem with this approach is one of combinatoric complexity. At every computation of $V\\left(s_t\\right)$, we must loop over all guesses, all possible answers, and all possible subsequent $s_{t+1}$. Even if the values for all subsequent states are known, this has a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(|\\mathbb{G}|\\cdot|\\mathbb{A}|\\cdot|\\mathbb{S}_{t+1}|\\right)$ where $\\mathbb{S}_{t+1}$ is the number of possible next states for each combination of $g$ and $a_\\text{true}$. The problem is compounded because the size of the state space $\\mathbb{S}$ (and therefore both the size of $\\mathbb{S}_{t+1}$ _and_ the number of calls to compute $V$) explodes as we allow recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combinatorial complexity is driven by the need to consider _all possible outcomes_ on _all possible turns_ between now and the end of the game. These are controlled by two interacting components:\n",
    "1. the number of words in the game, $|\\mathbb{W}_\\text{all-words}|$.\n",
    "2. the number of turns one must consider (depth of recursion).\n",
    "\n",
    "When we consider all possible guesses, solving this game is therefore computationally intractable. Instead we attempt to simplify the computation in several ways:\n",
    "- We always guess RAISE as the first word, which dramatically reduces the number of possible answers in the game (and so the size of the state space), and we only need to compute $V$ for the remaining states\n",
    "- If $|\\mathbb{A}| > 6$, we reduce the size of $\\mathbb{G}$ to exclude any words which are not expected to remove at least 50% of words in $\\mathbb{A}$. This means: when there are many possible answers, we only consider guesses which are expected to explore effectively. This removes the consideration of very-long games, in which we repeatedly make poor guesses leading to very deep recursion.\n",
    "- Reduce the number of words in the game (currently solved for 500)\n",
    "- When computing the argmax, further reduce the number of possible guesses to a random selection of 30, when the true number exceeds this, plus any possible answers which are not included. Random sampling \n",
    "- When computing the expectation over possible answers, reduce the number of possible answers to a random selection of 30, if the true number exceeds this\n",
    "\n",
    "N.B. when randomly sampling subsets, we control the numpy random seed used to make this choice so that it makes the _same_ choice every time it runs again ont eh same state. This means that different games do not consider different subsets of possible guesses and answers, requiring re-computation for every game. "
