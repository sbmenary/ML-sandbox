    "An attention layer takes $N$ feature vectors as input and creates $N$ feature vectors as output. For each token, we look at the features of a reference sequence. Using a simple linear transformation of the token and reference token features, we calculate a set of _attention weights_ that determine how much information the token should be pulling from the reference. The attention weights are normalised to unity using a `softmax` operation to maintain a consistent scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-attention occurs when the query and reference are the same sequence. Our model effectively allows the tokens to pass information to one another with strengths determined by the attention matrix. This makes the self-attention layer a type of graph network with a continuous adjacency matrix defined by the attention weights. The strength of information diffusion is small when the attention mechanism deems the tokens to be independent. We could view other attention layers as graph networks as well, where the graph contains both the query and reference sequences and the adjacency matrix contains many $0$s so that information may only propagate in certain directions.\n"

    "## Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the transformation $x^{i,l} \\rightarrow x^{i,l+1}$, where $x^{i,l}$ is the feature vector for token $i$ in layer $l$. We \"attend\" to a _set of_ vectors $\\{y^j \\forall j\\}$ (the feature vectors of the reference sequence). We do this by performing a linear transformation $Q^{i}_\\alpha = \\sum_\\beta A_{\\alpha\\beta} x^{i,l}_\\beta$, and a separate linear transformation $K^{j}_\\alpha = \\sum_\\beta B_{\\alpha\\beta} y^{j}_\\beta$ for every $j$. The strength of the connection is calculated as the dot product $s_{i,j} = \\sum_\\alpha Q^{i}_\\alpha K^{j}_\\alpha= \\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma} y^{j}_\\gamma B^T_{\\gamma\\alpha} A_{\\alpha\\beta} x^{i,l}_\\beta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention weights are obtained by enforcing positive definiteness and normalisation to unity using a `Softmax` function, $w_{ij} ~=~ \\mathrm{Softmax}_j\\left(s_{ij}\\right)$ which allows us to interpret $w_{ij}$ as a probability distribution over $j$. At this stage, all we have done is calculate a matrix connecting element $i$ of the query sequence with element $j$ of the reference matrix. This is turned into an actual propagation of node features by (i) transforming the reference sequence into a new sequence of feature vectors called _values_, then (ii) aggregating these value vectors according to the attention weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same method as for keys, the value vectors are calculatd as $V^{j}_\\alpha = \\sum_\\beta C_{\\alpha\\beta} y^{j}_\\beta$. The updated features are then calculated as $x_\\mu^{i,l+1} = \\sum_{j} w_{ij} V^{j}_\\mu$. Compacting the indices over feature vectors, we may summarise the entire layer as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\mathrm{Attention}\\left(Q,K,V\\right) ~=~ \\mathrm{Softmax}\\left(QK^T\\right)~V\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Why do we want to write the attention layer in this way? The answer is that we may construct $Q$, $K$ and $V$ in whatever way we want. Here we used simple `matmul` transformations using the matrices $A$, $B$ and $C$. But we didn't have to! For example, we can use dense layers that are the same but with additive bias terms, or CNN layers, and we may share layers when constructing $Q$, $K$ and $V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, we have one more detail to include. We have implemented \"dot-product attention\", because the attention weights $w_{ij}$ are calculated as the dot-product of the transformed feature vectors of length $d_k$. Other forms of attention mechanism are possible, e.g. additive attention. Now, if $d_k$ is very large, then the function $w_{ij}\\sim\\exp\\left[s_{ij}\\right]=\\exp\\left[\\sum_\\alpha Q^{i}_\\alpha K^{j}_\\alpha\\right]$. If we model the intial query-key pairs as normally distributed with mean $0$ and variance $1$, then the exponent is a sum of $d_k$ normal distributions, which itself is a normal distribution with variance $d_k$. We now have $w_{ij} \\sim \\exp\\left[\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0;d_k)\\right]$. As $d_k$ gets larger, the variance gets larger, and so we begin to see large values in the exponent. However, the _gradient_ of the `Softmax` function becomes very small for large exponents. This makes learning very slow. To counteract this effect, the AIAYN paper scales the dot-product by $1/\\sqrt{d_k}$ so the scale of arguments is roughly independent of $d_k$:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\mathrm{Attention}\\left(Q,K,V\\right) ~=~ \\mathrm{Softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)~V\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Of course, the $Q$ and $K$ matrices should be initialised such that they have reasonable values themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other configurable length is the size of the output feature vectors, $d_v$. In principle this can be any length, but we often use the same as the input so they may be linearly combined. This means that all feature vectors will be the same length throughout the model, and we can call this $d_\\mathrm{model}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now try to implement a custom attention layer. Of course, Keras has it's own attention layers, but for education purposes we will implement our own.\n"

    "We will build a sequence encoder by stacking blocks build on the attention mechanism. Each block will perform **self-attention**, meaning that we use the same sequence for both the query and reference. This means that a sequence will attend to itself to create an abstract representation, just like how we stack layers in a CNN or MLP. \n",
    "\n",
    "To construct each block, the first ingredient we will add is a **skip connection**. This means that we use addition or concatenation to combine the output of the attention layer with its own input to create a joint representation. In our case we will use addition to retain the same dimensionality. We could include a variable scalar to control how much information we want to include from the processed vs unprocessed representations, although the original AIAYN does not. Perhaps this is because this scale will be learned naturally as the scale of $V$. Skip connections can be _short_ skipping only one or two layers, or _long_ skipping many layers and maybe connecting directly to the final processing layers. We will use short skipp connections that bypass only the multi-head attention layer. The advantages of skip connections are:\n",
    "- we may re-use low-level features in our output / later layers\n",
    "- if e.g. positional information is lost in the attention layer, it may still propagate further down the network\n",
    "- allow us to learn deeper networks (unclear about explanation of why)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use **layer normalisation** to keep our activations on a consistent scale. This is like batch normalisation, but it applies to individual datapoints rather than batches. For this reason, it only really works if the dimension $d_v$ is large enough, so the activations form a distribution with some notable shape. Note that vectors $[-1, 9]$, $[400, 500]$, $[-0.1, 0.1]$ etc will all be represented as $[-1, 1]$ after layer normalisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of feeding the resulting feature vectors directly into a new layer, we will introduce two dense layers to process the vector. This will turn the information into something abstract that will work together with the next to propagate information efficiently. The first layer has dimension $d_{ff}$ and a `relu` activation, and the second layer has dimension $d_v$ and a linear activation. Once again we will combine the output with a skip connection so the encoder block may be considered to _modify_ and not _replace_ the input.\n",
