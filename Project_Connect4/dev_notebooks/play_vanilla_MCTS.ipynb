    "Brief : Develop a simple Connect 4 game environment and implement a bot using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Connect 4 is a two-player, fully-observable, zero-sum game. \n",
    "- The game states may be represented as a tree sturcture, We can therefore implement a bot using tree-search algorithms. We choose Connect 4 because it is simple, and therefore provides a launch-pad for more complex games such as checkers or chess.\n",
    "- Initially we implement vanilla MCTS with no machine learning. We expect this to be limited by (i) the stochastic rollout of the tree and (ii) the simplicity of the simulation policy.\n",
    "- To introduce ML, we would perform alternate steps of MCTS evaluation and simulation policy improvement. In this way, the simulated games will _hopefully_ begin to approach \"good play\", and the final MCTS values will reflect the behaviour of good players.\n",
    "- MCTS configuration:\n",
    "    + Tree-traversal policy is:\n",
    "        1. From the current node, uniformly-randomly select a non-expanded child if one is available\n",
    "        2. Otherwise select child with highest UCB-1 score, traverse to this node and repeat\n",
    "    + Resulting node is expanded by adding all possible children and selecting one by performing a uniformly-random action\n",
    "    + Simulation policy is to select a uniformly-random action\n",
    "- The UCB-1 score is designed to optimally balance exploration/exploitation for static multi-arm bandits. Strictly speaking, we are applying this in a non-stationary environment because the reward-distribution for each action changes according to the evolution of the down-stream tree. This makes UCB-1 theoretically sub-optimal. However, it is often used nonetheless.\n",
    "- When playing an actual move (i.e. inference time), greedily select the action with the max average score from its MCTS visits (do not use UCB-1 since we are no longer exploring).\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations:\n",
    "- Strength of decision-making depends on how many iterations of MCTS we perform:\n",
    "    1. When tree is shallow, we effectively assume that future play is random, which means we will choose options with the greatest number of permutations of winning. We therefore may neglect to defend against an imminent loss, favouring a different move with many win permutations (bad behaviour).\n",
    "    2. When tree is deep and UCB1 score converges towards true means, at least for the best moves, then we effectively assume that future play is optimal. As play-count goes to infinity, our scores become unbiased.\n",
    "    3. For finite but sufficient run-time, we assume optimal play, but using mean scores that are biased by the fact that our early simulations used random play instead of optimal play.\n",
    "- This explains why even random simulation MCTS is pretty good - we end up doing most of our simulations with pretty effective play, at least for the next few moves where our tree is sufficiently grown.\n"
